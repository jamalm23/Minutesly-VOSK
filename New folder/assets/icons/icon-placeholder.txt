This is a placeholder file for the extension icons.

In a real implementation, you would replace these with proper icon files:

1. icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
2. icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
3. icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

The icons should follow the Chrome extension design guidelines and represent
the audio recording and transcription functionality of the extension.

Suggested icon design:
- Microphone icon
- Sound wave visualization
- Blue color scheme matching the extension UI
- Clean, minimalist design following Material Design principles
